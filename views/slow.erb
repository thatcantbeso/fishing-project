<h2>Worm</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.bassmaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/senkos_on_box-scaled.jpg" alt="The many different ways to fish a senko" style="width:600px;height:400px;"><br>The worm or "senko" is a classic bait used by many fisherpeople. Popularized by Gary Yamamoto, the senko can be fished practically anywhere, everywhere, and any time. In fact, it is my crutch. When the bite is hard, this is my last resort. I like to fish this lure either with a "texas-rig" weightless or "wacky-rig". Those bass cannot resist the wiggle this lure puts off.</p><hr>

<h2>Tube</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.northwoodsbass.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cribs_tubes.jpg" alt="The different ways to rig a tube" style="float:right;width:500px;height:400px;">The tube is a very interesting lure. It's quite an antiquated lure and not very popular. These can be somewhat difficult to find and especially finding the certain jigheads for. However, using a tube can be extremely rewarding. Bass are not used to seeing these lures and you will have a higher chance at hooking up. Rigging these just straight through with a tube-jig or "stupid rigging" is very fun.</p><hr>

<h2>BIG WORMS</h2>
<p><img src="https://content.osgnetworks.tv/gameandfishing/content/photos/gaf-gobigbassLURES.jpg" alt="Different styles of monster worms" style="float:left;width:500px;height:400px;">BIG worms can be very rewarding. Bigger baits should equal to bigger fish, right? Most of the time. Big worms are best used during early spring, mid summer, and middle/late fall. When bass really need to feed and are sometimes feeling lazy, they barely want to move and conserve energy. That's when you throw a 8-10 inch worm. Sometimes when the senko doesn't work, an even larger worm will. Fishing these with a "texas-rig" would be best.</p>
