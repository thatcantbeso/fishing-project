Swimbaits are able to be fished almost anywhere almost any style. They are similar to senkos in this manner. They mimic a fleeing baitfish so fishing them with varying speeds can be very beneficial. I love throwing these in early mornings and watching the fish attack this bait. It almost guarantees fish to follow these baits. Rigging these either just hook through with a jig head is great but also underspins and weighted swimbait hooks are fantastic.</p><hr>

<h2>Crankbaits</h2>
<p><img src="https://norrik.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/crankbait-styles.jpg" alt="Different Crankbait Styles" style="float:right;width:300px;height:400px;">Crankbaits might be one of the easiest "mind-off" baits for any type of fisherperson. Besdies the lipless crankbait, these can be thrown even in rocks and cover! Because of theri bill, they dart off of cover and that reaction will cause bass to swim up and attack these lures. Plus, many of them float, are slow sinking, or only dive to a certain foot. This makes crankbaits very invovled yet still very rewarding. </p><hr>

<h2>Jerkbaits</h2>

These lures can be very intimidating, but learning how to fish them can be extremely rewarding. It can be some of the hardest hitting fish bites from jerkbaits. These are extremely variable to fish as well, a quick tug on the rod can send these baits swaying left and right which excites bass like nothing else. Sometimes, you can even catch two bass on one jerkbait. These are best fished early morning and late evenings.</p>
