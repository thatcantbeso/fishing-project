If you are a beginniner and are able to catch a bass on a frog, you may be addicted for life. The top water blow ups from frog fishing has got to be the most sastisfying fish catch. The amount of noise from nothing to a bass emerging above the water is unlike nothing else. However, some special gear is required to use frogs since you will have to set the hook strong. Usually a longer and "medium-heavy/heavy" rod will be required as well as heavier line to pull these bass from deep cover. </p><hr>

This bait is made by river2sea and has inspired many other companies to create similar top water baits that make a ton of noise. These baits create so much noise that it can draw out fish from many feet away. In addition, these are also extremely versatile as they were not originally used for bass fishing but for musky, a larger slim-bodied fish. Because of the popularity of the whopper plopper, they are best fished early in the morning and late evening when the bite window opens.</p> <hr>

<h2>Quick Note</h2>
<p>Top water baits can be extremely tricky to use. They require a certain amount of criteria to be met before usually any bass striking them. The temperature usually has to be above 65Â°F and it has to be within bite zones like early morning or late evening. Furthermore, weather can also heighten the awareness of bass as well. Usually throwing top water baits on calm to slightly windy days will go well. Cloud coverage can also affect strikes as well.</p>
